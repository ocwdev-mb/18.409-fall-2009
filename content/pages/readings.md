Readings on Spectral Graph Theory
---------------------------------

Andersen, R., F. Chung, K. Lang. "[Local Graph Partitioning using PageRank Vectors](http://www.leonidzhukov.net/hse/2015/networks/papers/andersen06localgraph.pdf)" in _Proceedings of the 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science_, 475-486. Washington, DC: IEEE, October 21-24, 2006.

> This is the conference version of Andesen, Chung, and Lang paper on local cutting with PageRank vectors. There is also a longer journal version.

Dan Spielman's Notes on Lovasz-Simonovits Theorem

> Notes from Dan Spielman's course on _Spectral Graph Theory_ about the Lovasz-Simonovits theorem. ({{% resource_link 0881d6e3-e4cf-fd9b-c180-cfced61579f0 "PDF" %}}) (Courtesy of Dan Spielman. Used with permission.)

Jerrum, M., and A. Sinclaire. "Approximating the Permanent." _SIAM Journal on Computing_ 18 (1989): 1149-1178.

> This is the original Jerrum-Sinclair paper on approximating the permanent. I looked for a nice textbook writeup or set of lecture notes for the result, but this paper is so beautifully written that I think it's still the best place to read about the result. We'll only cover pp. 1149-1160 (in the journal's page numbers).

Motwani, Rajeev, and Prabhakar Raghavan. _Randomized Algorithms_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. ISBN: 9780521474658.  
See section 11.3. This is the section of Motwani and Raghavan's book "_Randomized Algorithms_." that covers approximating the permanent.

Dan Spielman's Example Computations

> These are notes from a lecture given in another class that covered spectral graph theory. In them, many of the examples from today's class (including the grid graph and graph products) are worked out in detail.
