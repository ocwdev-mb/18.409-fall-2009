description: Hints for a problem set on iterative methods for linear algebra, computing
  eigenvalues with the power method, speeding up eigenvalue computation and the Lanczos
  method, reducing diagonally dominant linear systems to Laplacians, building augmented
  spanning tree preconditioners, Chebyshev polynomials, lattices, small solutions
  to modular polynomial equations and attacking, and low-exponent RSA encryption.
